## Intro

> The regulation of mood in the human brain involves a complex `network` of neurological pathways, neurotransmitters, and brain regions.

### Brain Anatomy

![brain-anatomy](brain-anatomy.jpg)

1. **Forebrain** (Prosencephalon /ˌpräs-ˌen-ˈse-fə-ˌlän, -lən /)

> The forebrain is the largest and most complex part of the brain, comprising several key areas involved in advanced cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and sensory processing.

- **Cerebral Cortex**: The outermost layer of the brain, responsible for complex cognitive processes such as reasoning, language, and conscious thought. It is divided into four lobes:
  - _Frontal Lobe_: Involved in decision making, problem solving, planning, and parts of speech and movement control.
  - _Parietal Lobe_: Processes sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain, and is involved in spatial orientation and manipulation.
  - _Occipital Lobe_: Primarily responsible for visual processing.
  - _Temporal Lobe_: Involved in auditory processing, memory, and integrating sensory input with emotional valence.
- **Limbic System**: A group of interconnected structures located deep within the brain, important for emotion, behavior, and memory. Key components include the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus.
- **Basal Ganglia**: A group of nuclei that regulate movement, process information related to emotions, motivation, and reward.

2. **Midbrain** (Mesencephalon /ˌme-ˌzen-ˈse-fə-ˌlän, ˌmē-, -zən-, -ˌsen-, -sən-, -lən /)

> The midbrain is a small part of the brainstem that acts as a relay station between various parts of the nervous system, including auditory, visual, and motor systems.

- _Tectum_: Involved in auditory and visual reflexes.
- _Tegmentum_ (/teg-ˈmen-təm /): Contains structures that are crucial for eye movement, body movement, and regulating arousal.

3. **Hindbrain** (Rhombencephalon /ˌräm-(ˌ)ben-ˈse-fə-ˌlän, -lən/)

> The hindbrain is critical for maintaining vital bodily functions and includes the following structures:

- _Cerebellum_: Helps in maintaining balance, coordinating movement, and fine motor control. It also plays roles in motor learning and cognitive functions.
- _Pons_: A bridge between various parts of the brain, involved in motor control and sensory analysis. It also plays a role in sleep and dreaming.
- _Medulla Oblongata_: Controls autonomic functions such as breathing, heart rate, and digestion.

4. **Brainstem**

> Connects the brain to the spinal cord, the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. It is essential for regulating basic life functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.

5. **Ventricular System** /ven-ˈtri-kyə-lər, vən- /

- **Ventricles** /ˈventrɪkl/: Cavities within the brain that produce and transport cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spinal cord.

### Limbic System

This group of interconnected structures in the brain is crucial for emotion regulation. Major components include the amygdala, hippocampus, and parts of the thalamus.

![limbic](limbic.jpg)

1. **Medial Temporal Lobe**

- **Hippocampus**: Located in the medial temporal lobe, the hippocampus is crucial for the formation and retrieval of memories. It plays a significant role in how memories are associated with emotions, which affects mood regulation.
- **Amygdala**: Also situated in the medial temporal lobe, the amygdala is key for emotional processing. It reacts to emotional stimuli and is involved in generating responses to potential threats, influencing fear and other emotions.

2. **Subcortical Structures**

- **Hypothalamus**: Though technically not always classified strictly within the limbic system, the hypothalamus, located below the thalamus, plays a critical role in regulating autonomic and endocrine functions in response to emotional stimuli. It helps maintain homeostasis and is involved in emotional responses through hormonal secretion.

3. **Cingulate Cortex** ['sɪŋgjəleɪt]

- **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**: Located just above the corpus callosum, the ACC is involved in cognitive functions such as decision-making, empathy, impulse control, and emotion. It’s important for assessing the emotional outcome of actions and resolving conflicts between internal goals and external demands.

4. Other Associated Areas

- Parahippocampal Gyrus: Surrounding the hippocampus, this region is involved in memory encoding and retrieval. It plays a role in spatial memory and navigation, which can be emotionally relevant in certain contexts.
- Olfactory Bulb: Involved in the sense of smell, the olfactory bulb has direct connections to the amygdala and hippocampus, linking smells with emotional memories, although it's often less emphasized in discussions about the core limbic structures.

### Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)

The `PFC` is _crucial_ for _cognitive_ aspects of mood regulation, such as judgment, decision-making, and problem-solving. Different parts of the PFC have specific roles:

- **Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC)**: Involved in the evaluation of risks and rewards and in controlling impulsive behavior.
- **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)**: Associated with the management of emotional responses through connections with the limbic system, playing a key role in mood disorders.

### Neurotransmitters

These chemical messengers are pivotal in mood regulation. Key neurotransmitters include:
Serotonin: Often linked to feelings of well-being and happiness. Low levels of serotonin are commonly associated with mood disorders like depression.

- Dopamine: Involved in the reward circuit and affects pleasure and motivation. Imbalances can affect mood, leading to conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder.
- Norepinephrine: Linked to arousal and alertness, changes in its levels are also associated with mood disorders.
- GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid): Mainly an inhibitory neurotransmitter that can stabilize mood.

### More

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis**

This system controls reactions to stress and regulates many body processes, including mood. Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been linked to several mood disorders.

**Neural Circuits**

The connections between the PFC, amygdala, hippocampus, and other areas like the striatum and nucleus accumbens are integral in mood and emotional regulation. Disruptions or imbalances in these circuits can lead to mood disorders.
