## Intro

RuBisCO, which stands for `Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase`, is a crucial enzyme in the process of photosynthesis, primarily responsible for the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic molecules. It is the most abundant protein on Earth due to its central role in carbon fixation, supporting the vast majority of life by contributing to the global carbon cycle.

RuBisCO, the enzyme essential for **photosynthesis** in organisms, comprises an `L8S8` structure with eight _large_ subunits (L) and eight _small_ subunits (S). Each large subunit weighs between 51 and 58 kDa, while each small subunit ranges from 12 to 18 kDa (see Figure 1). The large subunits are synthesized within the `chloroplast stroma` and are encoded by the chloroplast genome. In contrast, the small subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome of photosynthetic cells. After their synthesis, these small subunits are transported into the `chloroplast stroma`, passing through the chloroplast's outer and inner membranes. The proper folding and assembly of these subunits into the functional RuBisCO enzyme require the assistance of chaperone proteins. Functionally, the large subunits contain the catalytic sites essential for activity, while the small subunits play a crucial regulatory role in the enzyme's operation.

### RuBisCo

RubisCO is a `carboxylase` _(an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a carboxyl ROOH group to a specified substrate)_.

> RuBisCO catalyzes the **first** major step of the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis. This step involves the attachment of carbon dioxide to `ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate` (RuBP), a _five-carbon sugar_, to form two molecules of `3-phosphoglycerate`, a _three-carbon compound_. This reaction is crucial for the synthesis of sugars that plants use for energy and growth.

**Challenges with RuBisCO**

_Despite its essential role_, RuBisCO is _NOT_ particularly efficient or selective. It can also catalyze the reaction of oxygen with RuBP, leading to a process called `photorespiration`, which is energetically wasteful for the plant. Photorespiration consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, essentially undoing some of the work of photosynthesis. This inefficiency is particularly problematic under conditions of high temperature and low carbon dioxide concentrations.

## The Calvin Cycle

> The Calvin Cycle, also known as the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, is a series of biochemical redox reactions that take place in the `stroma` of `chloroplasts` in photosynthetic organisms. This cycle is the primary pathway for **carbon fixation**, converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic molecules like glucose. It is named after Melvin Calvin, who was one of the first to elucidate its steps.

### Overview of the Calvin Cycle

The Calvin Cycle is a crucial part of photosynthesis and can be divided into three main phases: carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration of the starting molecule, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). Unlike the light reactions of photosynthesis, which convert solar energy into chemical energy, the Calvin Cycle uses the chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) produced during these reactions to fix carbon and synthesize sugars.

## Types of Plants

### C3 Plants

C3 plants are the most common type of photosynthetic plant. In C3 photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is fixed directly into a three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate, by the enzyme RuBisCO. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of the leaf mesophyll cells. C3 photosynthesis is straightforward but not very efficient under high temperature and low carbon dioxide conditions because RuBisCO also reacts with oxygen, leading to a wasteful process called photorespiration.

### C4 Plants

C4 plants have evolved a mechanism to efficiently capture carbon dioxide, even under low concentrations, which is advantageous in hot and dry environments. In these plants, carbon dioxide is initially fixed into a four-carbon compound, oxaloacetate, which is converted into malate or aspartate. This initial reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), which has a higher affinity for CO2 and does not react with oxygen. This four-carbon compound is then shuttled to specialized bundle sheath cells, where the CO2 is released and re-fixed by RuBisCO into the C3 pathway. This spatial separation of the initial and final carbon fixation steps reduces photorespiration and increases photosynthetic efficiency under high light intensity and temperature.

### CAM Plants

CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants have adapted to extremely arid conditions by fixing carbon dioxide at night when the stomata (leaf pores) can be open with less water loss. During the night, CAM plants fix CO2 into organic acids (like malate) and store them in vacuoles. During the day, the stomata close to conserve water, and the stored CO2 is released from the organic acids for use in the Calvin cycle (the same cycle used by C3 and C4 plants). This temporal separation of CO2 uptake and fixation allows CAM plants to photosynthesize during the day with minimal water loss.
